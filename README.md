# Predicting the Number of COVID Cases

  	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov2 virus has become the world's most serious and contentious health issue. 
  It is associated with a variety of clinical manifestations as well as a high mortality rate. Estimating the number of total cases and identifying outcome 
  predictors are crucial for countries to counter the suffering from high cases of COVID. To reduce the complexity of disease phenotypes, multivariate and 
  machine learning methods can be used to develop prediction models. Machine learning algorithms have long been used in many applications that require the
  detection of adverse risk factors. Computational methods for machine learning (ML) have demonstrated their functionality in predicting potential outcomes
  to carry out informed decisions. The ability of ML modeling to predict the number of individuals affected by COVID-19 as a potential threat to humans is 
  demonstrated in this study.

    In December 2019, Wuhan, China, reported an outbreak of a highly infectious respiratory disease that was later identified as Coronavirus Disease 2019.
  COVID-19 has since spread throughout the world, affecting many people's lives in various ways. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers created
  machine learning models to help predict outbreaks, allowing the medical system and government to prepare and allocate resources ahead of time.
	
	  In times of crisis, the effectiveness of policymakers' decision-making is heavily reliant on their ability to integrate and interpret the information. 
  The COVID-19 crisis forces governments to make difficult decisions in the name of public health and safety. Essentially, policymakers must respond to 
  an unknown threat while making decisions under time constraints and in the face of enormous uncertainty. The stakes are high, the situation is complex,
  and several interests, including (mental) health, the economy, and human rights, must be cautiously balanced.
  
	  The coronavirus affects everyone on the planet, either directly or indirectly. Someone can be directly confronted when the virus attacks them, and
  others may be indirectly affected due to the closure of their businesses, work, and daily activities. The spread of this disease has had significant
  impacts on the global economy. It affects all countries, whether they are developing, developed, or under development. Our goal is to raise awareness 
  of the total number of future cases so that people can protect themselves and unite the world in order to eradicate this disease and its existence.
